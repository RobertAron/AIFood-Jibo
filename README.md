#Rock Paper Jibo

Jibo is a friendly social little robot. This project was done for MLH Prime - a hackathon project completed in less than 24 hours.

Rock paper jibo's goal was to teach jibo to play the game rock paper scissors. The two main sections of completing the project involved computer vision and learning Jibo's sdk. Jibo is currently in pre-release state, and the SDK is currently under development. Tools were given to us, allowing us to create jibo 'animations' and responses to things said to it through the use of it's 'grammar' functionality. Once we developed the framework for the application we went to work on developing a computer vision call that we made, to determine if which gesture was picked for the game. This call was made to a custom online database, where we compared the image jibo takes with his camera to our training images.
